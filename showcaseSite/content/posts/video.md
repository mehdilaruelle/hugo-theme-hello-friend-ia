An animated GIF is a poor way to ship a screen recording. A few seconds of
motion runs to megabytes, and a reader cannot stop it. Measured on an eleven
second, 3840×2160 capture:

| file | size |
| --- | --- |
| `demo.gif` | 4248 Ko |
| `demo.mp4` | 366 Ko |
| `demo.webm` | 290 Ko |

The `video` shortcode takes the path without an extension and emits one
`<source>` per format, so the browser takes the first it can play:

{{< video src="/video/demo" poster="/video/demo.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="A test pattern looping" >}}

It autoplays, muted, on a loop — exactly like the GIF it replaces, so an article
reads the same. Pass `controls="true"` when a clip is long enough that a reader
may want to stop it, which a GIF never allowed:

{{< video src="/video/demo" poster="/video/demo.jpg" width="640" height="360" controls="true" alt="A test pattern" >}}

`width` and `height` matter more here than for an image: a video has no
intrinsic size until it loads, so without them the page reflows when it arrives.
The `poster` is what fills the frame in the meantime.

Hugo has no built-in shortcode for this. It ships `youtube` and `vimeo`, but
those embed somebody else's player; there is nothing for a file you host
yourself.

A list row is a title, a date at the far right, and now an excerpt under both.
With a cover the title is already told to take the space the thumbnail and the
date leave. Without one it was not, so a title this long pushed the date onto
the next flex line, where `space-between` left it at the start rather than at
the end.

This page exists so that row is built, and looked at, on every run.

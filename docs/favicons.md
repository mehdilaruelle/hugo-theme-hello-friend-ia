# Favicons

Use [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate these
files, and put them in your site's `static` folder:

| file | how it is reached |
| --- | --- |
| `favicon.ico` | linked by the theme |
| `favicon-16x16.png` | linked by the theme |
| `favicon-32x32.png` | linked by the theme |
| `apple-touch-icon.png` | linked by the theme |
| `safari-pinned-tab.svg` | linked by the theme |
| `site.webmanifest` | linked by the theme |
| `android-chrome-192x192.png` | named inside `site.webmanifest`, not in the HTML |
| `android-chrome-512x512.png` | named inside `site.webmanifest`, not in the HTML |
| `mstile-150x150.png` | named inside `browserconfig.xml`, which Windows looks for at the site root |

The six the theme links are each linked **only when the file is present**, so a
site without them emits no broken links. The last three are never referenced
from the HTML at all — they are reached through the two files that name them,
which RealFaviconGenerator generates alongside the images. Ship those two files
too, or the three images are dead weight.

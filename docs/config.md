# Configuration

There are some settings you can set in your `config.toml`. 

## Default area

The settings in the default area are usually provided by Hugo itself. Check [Configure Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#all-configuration-settings) for more information. But I want to list some important things here which are relevant to this theme.

### paginate

```
paginate = 10
```

This setting will paginate your list views. Set to `0` to disable it. For more information check (https://gohugo.io/templates/pagination/).

## Footer copyright year

`params.footer.trademark` accepts either:

- `true` — renders the current year, so it never goes stale
- any value — rendered as given, for a fixed year or a range such as
  `"2019–2026"`

## Mermaid diagrams

Pages containing a ```mermaid code block load Mermaid from jsDelivr, pinned to
the current major version. Pinning means a future Mermaid major cannot silently
change how existing diagrams render; bump the version in
`layouts/_partials/javascript.html` when you want to move to the next one.

The library is fetched from a third party, so visitors to pages with diagrams
resolve jsDelivr. Pages without a diagram request nothing.
